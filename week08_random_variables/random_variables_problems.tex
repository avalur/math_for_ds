\section*{Homework 8 (10 points max)}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (1 point) Let $\xi$ be a random variable such that 
  $P(\xi = -1) = \frac{1}{4}$, $P(\xi = 2) = \frac{1}{4}$, 
  and for any points $a, b \in [0, 1]$ with $a < b$, 
  we have $P(\xi \in [a, b]) = \frac{b - a}{2}$.
  Draw the plot of the distribution function $F_{\xi}(x) = P(\xi \leq x)$. 
  Find the expected value and variance of $\xi$.

  \item (1 point) In a lottery, $1\%$ of the tickets win \$200, $0.01\%$ 
  of tickets win \$1000, and the remaining tickets do not win anything. 
  Find the average winnings in this lottery (per ticket), 
  i.e., the arithmetic mean of the winnings of all tickets. 
  Think about how to formulate this in terms of random variables 
  and expected value.

  \item (2 points) There are $m$ objects arranged in a row, $k$ objects are 
  randomly selected, $k < m$. The random variable $X$ equals the number 
  of such objects $i$ that $i$ is selected, 
  but all its neighbors are not. Find the expected value of $X$.

  \item (2 points) In an equilateral triangle $ABC$ of area 1, we select a point $M$. 
  Find the expected value of the area of $ABM$.

  \item (2 points) Find the expected value and variance of the variable $\xi$ 
  with density $p(x) = \frac{1}{2\alpha} e^{\frac{-|x-a|}{\alpha}}$.

  \item Let $P_{\xi}(x) = P(\xi = x)$ and $F_{\xi}(x) = P(\xi \leq x)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item (1 point) Show that for $a > 0$ and $-\infty < b < \infty$, 
      $P_{a\xi+b}(x) = P_{\xi}(\frac{x-b}{a})$ and 
      $F_{a\xi+b}(x) = F_{\xi}(\frac{x-b}{a})$
      \item (1 point) Find the distribution function $F_{\xi^2}(y)$ 
      (express it through $F_{\xi}$ and $P_{\xi}$)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
